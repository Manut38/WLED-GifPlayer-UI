## WLED GIFPlayer

A WLED UI extension for an easy control of the awesome new "Image" effect, capable of displaying animated GIFs on your LED matrix.

It is using the ESP filesystem editor at `/edit` to list and change files on the local ESP storage.

> [!WARNING]  
> **The 'Image Effect' (GIF support) currently has not been added to the stable WLED release yet**
> 
> To to anything useful with this UI, you will need to **use the current [WLED Nightly](https://github.com/wled/WLED/releases/tag/nightly)**, where the effect has been implemented. (as of 2025-06-26)
> 

## Features

- Click to change currently displayed image
- Upload/Delete image files
- Save images as presets
- Forced caching of images and request limiting (ESP crashes when there are too many concurrend HTTP requests)
- Button to refresh all images, useful when an image was replaced with another one of the same name

## Limitations

> [!WARNING]  
> **Only upload images in your matrix native resolution! (e.g. 16x16)**
> 
> Due to the limited flash storage space and processing power, .gif files of larger dimensions will make the effect lag and kill WLED performance

- Currently the "Image" effect only supports .gif files
- All image files will be uploaded to/read from the root path of WLEDs LittleFS because it does not support subfolders
- SD card support untested

# Installation

Download [gifplayer.htm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Manut38/WLED-GifPlayer-html/main/gifplayer.htm) and upload it to the WLED fileystem using `http://{WLED}/edit`

After that, the page can be accessed using `http://{WLED}/gifplayer.htm`

## Custom Host

If you want to use a custom WLED host, e.g when accessing the file from another web server or directly from the filesystem, you can adjust the `host` parameter in the URL like:

`/gifplayer.htm?host={WLED_IP}`
