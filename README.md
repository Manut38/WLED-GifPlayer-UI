## WLED GIFPlayer

A WLED UI extension for an easy control of the awesome new "Image" effect, capable of displaying animated GIFs on your LED matrix.

It is using the ESP filesystem editor at `/edit` to list and change files on the local ESP storage.

> [!WARNING]  
> **The 'Image Effect' (GIF support) has not been officially added to stable versions of WLED yet**
> 
> To use this project you will need to **build your own WLED binary** using the [gif branch](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/tree/gif), where the effect has been implemented.
> 
> Currently, the [pull request](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/pull/3835) to add the functionality into the main project remains unresolved, so for now a manual build is still required.

## Features

- Click to change currently displayed image
- Upload/Delete image files
- Save images as presets
- Forced caching of images and request limiting (ESP crashes when there are too many concurrend HTTP requests)
- Button to refresh all images, useful when an image was replaced with another one of the same name

## Limitations

> [!WARNING]  
> **Only upload images in your matrix native resolution! (e.g. 16x16)**
> 
> Due to the limited flash storage space and processing power, .gif files of larger dimensions will make the effect lag and kill WLED performance

- Currently the "Image" effect only supports .gif files
- All image files will be uploaded to/read from the root path of WLEDs LittleFS because it does not support subfolders
- SD card support untested
